There is a large community and a lot of support from other developers in the NodeJS environment. ExpressJS makes it very easy to write REST APIs. The weak typing of the language quickly gave me big problems that I was not used to from the C languages, so I switched to TypeScript. This step definitely made sense, and I would recommend anyone starting with TypeScript right away. Now I wish I had written the server in a different language such as Go. The front end is programmed in the Vue framework, which is a great and intuitive open source framework. I used a variety of other libraries for this purpose. Particularly noteworthy is PrimeVue, a UI component library, and Socket.io, a WebSocket implementation for real-time server communication. You can find links to the libraries worth mentioning under this article. All libraries are freely accessible and without them a project like this would not be possible!"
